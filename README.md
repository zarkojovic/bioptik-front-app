# Bioptik Front App

## Description
Bioptik Front App is a native JavaScript and jQuery application designed for selling sunglasses. It provides various features such as adding items to the cart using local storage, filtering and sorting sunglasses, and placing orders. The application retrieves data from JSON files and utilizes AJAX requests for enhanced functionality.
